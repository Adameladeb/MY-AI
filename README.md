Personal Assistant

This Python code is a simple personal assistant that uses speech recognition to process user commands and respond accordingly. The assistant can recognize and respond to simple voice commands related to music preferences and news headlines.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before running the code, you will need to install the following libraries:

    speech_recognition
    nltk
    pyttsx3
    wikipedia
    datetime
    webbrowser
    random
    spotipy
    requests

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install speech_recognition nltk pyttsx3 wikipedia datetime webbrowser random spotipy requests

Installation

    Clone this repository.

    Navigate to the cloned directory in your terminal or command prompt.

    Run the assistant.py file using Python 3:

    python assistant.py

Usage

When you run the assistant.py file, the assistant will start listening for voice commands. The assistant can currently recognize and respond to the following voice commands:

    "play some music"
    "play some rock music"
    "play some pop music"
    "play some hip hop music"
    "play some classical music"
    "play some jazz music"
    "play some rap music"
    "play some lofi music"
    "what's in the news?"
    "what's on Wikipedia?"

The assistant can also ask you for your name and music preferences when you start it up. If you haven't provided this information, the assistant will ask you for it when you try to play music.

Note: This code uses several APIs that require API keys or client credentials, and will need to be modified before it can be run.

    NewsAPI: You will need to sign up for a free NewsAPI account to obtain an API key, and replace the value of the NEWS_API_KEY variable in the YourAssistant class with your own API key.

    Spotify: You will need to create a Spotify developer account to obtain a client ID and client secret, and replace the values of the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET variables in the YourAssistant class with your own client ID and client secret. You will also need to replace "your_username" with your Spotify username in the token initialization code.

Note: It is important to keep your API keys and client credentials private and secure. Do not share them with anyone or include them in public code repositories.
